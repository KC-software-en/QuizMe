</The template system uses dot-lookup syntax to access variable attributes./>
</In the example of {{ question.question_text }}, first Django does a dictionary lookup on the object question./>
</Failing that, it tries an attribute lookup – which works, in this case. />
</If attribute lookup has failed, it would’ve tried a list-index lookup./>
<h1> {{question.question_text}}</h1>

</Method-calling happens in the {% for %} loop: 
question.choice_set.all is interpreted as the Python code question.choice_set.all(), 
which returns an iterable of Choice objects and is suitable for use in the {% for %} tag./>
<ul>
    {% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}
    <li> {{choice.choice_text}}</li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
