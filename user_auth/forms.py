"""
This module contains the NewUserForm class, which is used to create a form where the user can register.

The NewUserForm class inherits from the UserCreationForm class and overrides the save method to set the email field of the user instance to the value of the cleaned_data['email'] field.

The NewUserForm class defines the model and fields attributes to correspond to the User model and the fields that should be included in the form.

The save method of the NewUserForm class first calls the super().save() method to create the user instance, and then sets the email field of the user instance to the value of the cleaned_data['email'] field. If the commit parameter is set to True, the user instance is saved to the database.

The NewUserForm class is used in the views.py module to create the form for registering a new user.
